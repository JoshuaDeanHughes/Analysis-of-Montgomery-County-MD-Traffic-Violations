            <h1>Montgomery County, MD Traffic Stops</h1>
            <p>
                &Tab;Race, gender, and law enforcement biases have been an increasingly prevalent topic in the United States over the past couple of years with the spike of Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd.  These racial disparities are very prevalent in traffic stops.  Kelsey Shoub, political science professor at the University of South Carolina analyzed 20 million traffic stops across the US to uncover police discrimination of people of color.  The results were significant.  A few conclusions drawn from the analysis were that Blacks were 63% more likely to be stopped despite spending 16% less time on the road, and 95% more likely to be stopped when time on the road was accounted for.  Additionally, Blacks were 115% more likely to be searched, despite statistics showing that contraband was more likely to be found in vehicles of whites (Horn, 2022).

                &Tab;It is well known that law enforcement is systematically racist toward people of color, but what is often overlooked is the intersection of race and gender and its role in police discrimination.  A study done by the Prison Policy Initiative used data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program to investigate gender and racial disparities in both traffic and street stops.  The stops analyzed included arrests, searches, and use of force.  The study discovered surprising trends, such as the amount of female arrests and use of force towards females has increased significantly since 1999, both race and gender affect the outcome of traffic stops, race is a more prevalent factor in street stops for men whereas race is a more prevalent factor in female arrests during a stop, black and latino men experience the most use of force, and black women experience similar rates of force use as white men (Initiative, 2022).

                &Tab;This data inspired Ellie, Matthew, Josh and Audrey to take a closer look at the intersection of race and gender in traffic stops specifically.  Using Tableau, we analyze a government traffic stop dataset from Montgomery County, Maryland.  Racial disparities shown within Montgomery County police data suggest unconstitutional policing within the county.  A report from the Office of Legislative Oversight uncovered multiple significant statistics, such as that in 2018 Black residents of Montgomery County were subject to 32% of all traffic stops and 55% of cases that involved use of force by the officer, despite only making up 18% of the population (Iannelli, 2020).  Additionally, in 2019 statistics showed that black men were three times more likely, and latino men were twice as likely, to receive a traffic violation than white men (Iannelli, 2020).  On top of that, in March of 2021, body camera footage of a Montgomery County police officer shows an officer screaming at and threatening a five year old black boy  (Body Camera Footage Shows Montgomery County Police Officers Screaming At, Threatening A 5-Year-Old Black Boy, 2021).  Following the release of this information and the killing of George Flloyd in 2020, Montgomery County lawmakers and law enforcement promised change and equality, and even passed a use-of-force law that demands officers report when they see colleagues using excessive force (Tan & Morse, 2021).   But, has this promised change been implemented? The Montgomery County traffic stops data set provides information about the demographics of the person stopped, information about the stops such as why they were stopped, when they were stopped, where they were stopped, etc., and information about the outcome of the stop such as if they were let off with a warning, if they received a ticket, if a search was conducted, and if they were arrested.  Using this data, we aim to uncover racial/gender disparities within the county’s traffic stops, and if any true change has been made to end law enforcement discrimination.
                <br><br>
                &Tab;At the beginning of this project we assumed a couple of things based on basic trends; a) that gender plays a definite role in whether or not an individual receives a traffic ticket or a warning, and b) that race and ethnicity impact how frequently individuals get stopped and in the outcome of a stop (getting searched, arrested, ticketed etc.). When exploring the topic of gender within traffic violations, we found that some of the articles contradict each other. For example, in the article Gender bias in power relationships: evidence from police traffic stops it states that there is no true gender bias but rather the regional location has more of an impact on the likelihood of citations (Blalock et al., 2007).  In comparison to that, the article Gender Bias in the Enforcement of Traffic Laws: Evidence based on a new empirical test explains that men make up the majority of individuals getting tickets (64%) within the US (Rowe, 2008).  Additionally, we explored literature covering the influence of race and ethnicity on traffic violations and outcomes. We found an overwhelming response that supported our primary assumption - race and ethnicity impact the frequency and outcomes of traffic stops.  The literature, however, also examined additional factors, such age and location, that influence the frequency and outcomes of traffic stops of people of color.  For instance, the article The Impact of Drivers’ Race, Gender, and Age During Traffic Stops found that warnings and citations were disproportionately issued to young, Black, male drivers (Tillyer & Engel, 2010).  Moreover, the article Policing Race: The Racial Stratification of Searches in Police Traffic Stops shows that searches are more likely in stops of Black drivers than in those of White drivers, especially by White officers (ROJEK et al., 2012).  In addition to that we also gained a better understanding on how racial profiling goes on to effect people throughout their lives. As revealed in the article Traffic Stops, Race, and Perceptions of Fairness, citizens stopped for traffic violations, especially those who perceived unfair treatment, are significantly less likely to seek help from the police and/or report non-crime and emergency situations (Chenane et al., 2019).  This mixed information suggests that there are additional factors that impact traffic stops and outcomes than just race or gender alone.
                <br><br>
                &Tab;There is obviously a plethora of information and research available on racial and ethnic discrimination within law enforcement, and a decent amount of research done on gender discrepancies during traffic stops as well.  We hope to gain a better understanding on how race and gender together affect the outcomes of traffic stops.  In addition to that, law enforcement, including that of Montgomery County, has promised systematic changes toward greater equality since the happenings of 2020 that have been questionably implemented.  We aim to uncover if any significant changes have been made to decrease discriminatory practices within the Montgomery County Police Department.

                    <p>
                        In the article Gender bias in power relationships: evidence from police traffic stops, Blalock et al. examines whether police officers are less likely to give traffic tickets to men or women during traffic stops by analyzing traffic violations in five different regions in the United States. The conventional assumption is that women are less likely to be issued tickets, however, the results of the study reveal otherwise. The examinations concluded that there is no true gender bias in the issuing of tickets, but the regional location may impact the likelihood of citations. For example, the study found that women are more likely to receive a ticket in three of the five locations examined, whereas men were more likely to receive a ticket in the other two. This information will be helpful in our analyses of how race and gender affect whether a warning or ticket is given during a traffic stop.

                        In the article Demographic Patterns of Cumulative Arrest Prevalence by Ages 18-23, Robert Brame (professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina) along with many of his colleagues analyze race, sex, and self-reported histories from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth starting in the year 1997 and ending in 2008. With their main focus of attempting to describe and study what can be learned about race and sex differences in the cumulative risk of arrest by ages 18 to 23, their analyze yeilded many very important findings: (a) males have a higher cumulative prevalence of arrest then females, (b) there are important racial differences in the probability of arrest for males but not for females, and mainly that the risk of arrest is not evenly distributed across the population. This kind of the research is incredibly useful for our project because it touches many of our research questions regarding racial profiling as well as how arrests for minorities compare with white arrests.

                        In the article Traffic Stops, Race, and Perceptions of Fairness, Joselyne Chenane (Criminology and Justice Studies, University of Massachusetts) along with her colleagues ask and the study the questions regarding whether or not pos/neg interaction with the police through traffic stops affect how people contact the police in non-crime/emergency situations. As well as why perceptions of fairness and reasons for traffic stops might affect these outcomes across different racial/enthic categories. Their results yielded that citizens stopped for traffic violations and especially those who perceived unfair treatment are significantly less likely to seek help from the police and/or report non-crime and emergency situations. This article is useful for our research because not only does it address and analyze the unfair treatment in which many minorities face when it comes to the police, but it also examines how that unfairness goes on to influence future choices long-term when it comes to law enforcement.

                        Angela J. Davis, professor of law at the American University's Washington College of Law, is a specialist in criminal law with a focus on prosecutorial power and racism in the criminal justice system. In the Article Race, Cops, and Traffic Stops, Davis discusses the Supreme Courts negligence in providing a clear and effective solution for discriminatory pretextual traffic stops. Her discussion of the “discretionary nature of pretextual traffic stops and their discriminatory effect on African-Americans and Latinos”, along with her examination of realted court cases, will be helpful in our analysis of warnings, searches, and arrests based on race and gender.

                    <p>
                        A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States by E. Piereson et al. studies a multitude of datasets to examine situations where race may play a factor in police stops. Such as if more black drivers are stopped during the day as opposed to night where it is harder for the officer to determine a driver's race, whether or not the decision to search drivers for contraband has any bias, as well as if drug policy has an effect of these outcomes (States with or without legalized recreational marijuana). The datasets were collected by filing public record requests with each state's state patrol as well as several municipal police departments. Both the data & analysis in this paper helps guide the research of Montgomery County's data as well as how to digitally manage Montgomery County's data.

                        Brian Rowes’ paper, Brian talks about how men are ticketed more often than women. Men make up 64% of all tickets in the us. Also, in 2005 10.4% of all male drivers were stopped by the police and issued a ticket while only 6% of all female drivers were ticketed. Throughout the paper Brian is testing for bias towards men and women when it comes to getting ticketed all three datasets he uses are from massachusetts.

                        This study used data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program to investigate gender and racial disparities in both traffic and street stops. The stops analyzed included arrests, searches, and use of force. This study will be useful when giving background information on the intersection of race and gender within traffic stops, and will also help support our argument that the intersection of race and gender is worth considering.

                        The National Institute of Justice covers how people of color are more often stopped by police than white people. The question is whether it is racial profiling or other factors causing people of color to get stopped by the police more often. The article states “race is a consistent predictor of attitude toward the police”. They question if the bias towards people of color is an entire unit's problem or just a few specific officers. From one study in Cincinnati they concluded that white drivers and black drivers who were stopped for the same things were not equal length stops. Black people were stopped for longer because there were more often searches conducted.

                        In the article Policing Race: The Racial Stratification of Searches in Police Traffic Stops, Jeff Rojek (Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of South Carolina) along with his colleagues examine propositions from Donald Black’s theory of law to explain the interaction effects of officer and driver race on searches in traffic stops located in St. Louis, Missouri. Their results are as follows: (a) Searches are more likely in stops of Black drivers than in those of White drivers, especially by White officers; (b) In predominantly Black communities, stops of White drivers by White officers are most likely to result in a search. Rojek and his team understand both of these findings to be results of manifestations of racial profiling in segregated communities. This article is useful for our research because not only does it talk about race and the probability of stops and/or searches, but it also examines the racial identity of the officers at hand.

                        President Barack Obama's Executive Order 13642: Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government made releasing data from government agencies a process that has to be opted out of as opposed to in. An Open Data Policy was requested to be given within the administration to assess what data should be released to 'better serve the American People'. The benefits of having open government data being proven years ago by the release of the United States weather data & the Global Positioning System and of recently with the resources made available by Data.gov. This executive order could be one of the contributing factors to why many government agencies, local & federal, choose to release their data.
